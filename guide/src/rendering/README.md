# Rendering

This section implements Render Sync, the Swapchain loop, performs Swapchain image layout transitions, and introduces [Dynamic Rendering](https://docs.vulkan.org/samples/latest/samples/extensions/dynamic_rendering/README.html). Originally Vulkan only supported [Render Passes](https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/03_Drawing_a_triangle/02_Graphics_pipeline_basics/03_Render_passes.html), which are quite verbose to setup, require somewhat confusing subpass dependencies, and are ironically _less_ explicit: they can perform implicit layout transitions on their framebuffer attachments. They are also tightly coupled to Graphics Pipelines, you need a separate pipeline object for each Render Pass, even if they are identical in all other respects. This RenderPass/Subpass model was primarily beneficial for GPUs with tiled renderers, and in Vulkan 1.3 Dynamic Rendering was promoted to the core API (previously it was an extension) as an alternative to using Render Passes.
